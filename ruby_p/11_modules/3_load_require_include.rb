#!/usr/bin/env ruby

#load:
# load is rarely used
# it loads a file everytime it is called
# it returns true when a file is loaded

#require:
# it loads a source file only once 
# it returns true when a file is loaded

# Example: 
# require (full path or simply the library name)
# require_relative (when the file is on the same folder) 

#include:
# it includes modules in classes
# include has nothing to do with loading files
